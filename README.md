# Hospitable Financial Exporter
This is a Python script to export financial data from Hospitable to csv for a given date range.

## How it works
The `main.py` file is a python script that runs using a PAT generated from Hospitable to retrieve the financial data for a date range the you specify. It will then output this data into a .csv file for you to use.
Once the requirements have been met (below) simply run the `main.py` file and your csv will be created in an `output` directory.

## Requirements
1. Python is installed
2. The packages per the `requirements.txt` file are installed
3. A .env file is created to supply the necessary inputs (further details on this are below)
